    <p>Broccoli salad is a classic summer cookout dish, but the traditional recipe is loaded up with sugar, ample mayo, bacon, and cheese. 
        <b>My recipe is a fresher, healthier version – I nix the sugar, meat, and cheese altogether – and the result is a crisp, refreshing, <!-- short paragraph -->
        tangy dish that’ll be the star of your cookouts all summer long!</b></p>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li> Chop the broccoli florets into ½-inch pieces and any remaining stems into ¼-inch dice. Peel any woody or course parts from the stem first.</li>
            <li> In the bottom of a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, mayo, apple cider vinegar, mustard, maple syrup, garlic, and salt. 
                Add the broccoli, onions, and cranberries and toss to coat.</li>
            <li> Place the almonds and pepitas on the baking sheet, toss with the tamari, maple syrup, and smoked paprika and spread into a thin layer. Bake 10 to 14 minutes or until golden brown. 
                Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes (they’ll get crispier as they sit).</li>
            <li> Toss the almonds and pepitas into the salad, reserving a few to sprinkle on top. Season to taste and serve.</li>
        </ol>
